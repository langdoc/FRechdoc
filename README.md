# FRechdoc

This page contains technical documentation about tools and conventions used in Freiburg based language documentation projects. Earlier idea was to render it as a website from docs folder, but we are currently testing the possibility to use GitHub Wiki to this purpose.

## The documents not yet in Wiki (please update as you go)

- Engine.md
- GRAID.md
- TLA.md
- Toolbox.md
- tools.md
