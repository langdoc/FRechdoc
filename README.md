# FRechdoc

This page contains technical documentation about tools and conventions used in Freiburg based language documentation projects. Earlier idea was to render it as a website from docs folder, but we are currently testing the possibility to use GitHub Wiki to this purpose.

## ELAN templates

In folder `etf` there are two different ELAN templates. `template_fst` is meant to be used in conjunction with Giellatekno's FST tools, whereas `template_manual` can be used independently. In principle these two templates can interoperate, as the manual annotations are considered gold-standard into which the automatic annotations can be compared.

## Controlled vocabularies

**To be added!**
