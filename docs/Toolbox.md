This page documents conventions, standards and relevant workflows used for the annotation of the Freiburg-Tromsø Speech Corpora|freiburg.html] with the help of the software Toolbox.

Whereas we focus on working with the [FST analyzer|FST.html], parts of our [ELAN corpora|ELAN.html] are being analyzed by external collaboration projects using Toolbox.
